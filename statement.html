            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>

            <p>As an artist my works are deeply rooted in the lush beauty of 
                the Ozark Mountains in western Arkansas. As I have matured, I 
                have been fortunate to travel throughout our country, as well 
                as other countries around the world. I discovered an innate 
                sense of purpose between people and place. Life and art are 
                both complex. I find paved roads, bridges, buildings, road signs, 
                and other manmade structures to be viewed as symbols. These 
                symbols show a particular aspect of how humans interact with the 
                world in ways that are simultaneously beneficial and destructive. 
                There is a feeling of beauty and a feeling of melancholy, all in 
                the name of human advancements. Historically, I understand human 
                suffering, famine, and disease, however I can see progression, love, 
                and beauty. This is the nucleus of what I create.
            </p>

            <p>My work encompasses a range of media including drawing, painting, 
                printmaking, and mixed media. These techniques allow me to express the 
                relationships between people, structures, and locations while 
                simultaneously creating artwork that is visually captivating. I want my 
                audience to view my artwork as personal, but with a profound feeling 
                that it is theirs to experience as well.
            </p>

            <p>Thus far, my lifeâ€™s encounters have inspired my work. I see a fluid 
                movement in my art as human interaction with our environment continuously 
                shapes the way I see our planet.
            </p>
