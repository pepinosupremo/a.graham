            <h2>Addison Graham is a fine artist from Fort Smith, Arkansas. She 
                received her BFA from Arkansas Tech University in 2020 and is 
                currently working on her MFA at the University of South Carolina.
            </h2>

            <p>Addisonâ€™s studio practice is inspired by natural and manmade 
                landscapes, human emotion, and the various emotions that occur 
                within specific locations. These inquiries and experiences are 
                shown through expressive landscapes, mysterious figures, and 
                surreal aspects interwoven within the composition. Addison 
                continues to experiment with her emotions and relationship to 
                a place using various forms of mixed media. 
            </p>

            <p>Graham has exhibited in multiple cities in Arkansas and was 
                fortunate to be chosen as the first student solo exhibition 
                at the Fort Smith Regional Art Museum in 2019. 
            </p>

            <p>She resides in Columbia, South Carolina to further develop her 
                work as a graduate student and works as a graduate instructional 
                assistant for introduction painting classes. 
            </p>
